The Model

Student describes their model in detail. 
This includes the state, actuators and update equations.

State:

x - x position
y - y position
psi - angle of orientation
v - velocity
cte - cross track error
epsi - orientation error

Actuators:

Steering
Throttle

Update Equations:

Solve - sets up vehicle model constraints and variables for Ipopt
FG_eval - Polynomial coefficients are used to calculate cross track error and heading error


Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)

Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N 
(timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. 
Additionally the student details the previous values tried.

Final:
N = 10
d = 0.1
Tried:
N = 25
d = 0.05

T equals the product of N and d.  Model is executed for d elapsed seconds between actuations, and  N number of timesteps in the horizon.  
T should be no more than a few seconds.  Any longer and it won't make sense to make a prediction.  Larger d results in less frequent actuations.
